Here is the meat that is accomplished by using base.php and math.php. The first rule was no loops. 
There isn't any code in here (except in the example.php file) that uses loops. The second rule was no built in php functions. 
I failed at this, but made some pretty big ground. I don't use that many and will continue to try and refactor these to only 
use function from base.php and math.php. The third rule was to make each function as short as possible. That is why you see the possibly 
hard to read one liners. I might put the one line return statements on multiple lines. It almost looks like Scheme if you do that and squint your
eyes. This is largely based on a book I read last year called The Little Schemer, so thanks to that book and php.net.
